# Horizontal Diffusivity From Argo and Surface Drifter Trajectories

This repository provides easy access to the estimates of horizontal diffusivity in the ocean from surface drifter (GDP) and Argo float trajectories (Argo), calculated in 2017-18. 

The diffusivity was estimated using the two-particle relative diffusivity approach, which nominally provides an estimate of the across mean flow diffusivity. The methodology is presented in *Horizontal Mixing in the Southern Ocean from Argo float trajectories*, Roach, Balwada & Speer 2016, JGR-Oceans (https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JC011440), and the analysis on global datasets is presented in *Global Observations of Horizontal Mixing from Argo Float and Surface Drifter Trajectories*, Roach, Balwada & Speer 2018, JGR-Oceans (https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JC013750).
